Docker's Native support for Kubernetes
At DockerCon 2017 in Copenhagen, Docker announced that it's adding support to run applications using Dockerâ€™s Swarm orchestrator with Kubernetes on the same computer cluster itself!

Kubernetes is an container orchestration platform which we didn't cover much in this course(We are going to have a course about Kubernetes soon!) . You can think of Kubernetes as a Docker Swarm alternative, but Kubernetes is more production ready than Docker Swarm.

This is an exiting news! The introduction of Docker's native support for Kubernetes gives us the ability to make an orchestration choice with the added security, management and end-to-end Docker experience that we have expected for so long!
