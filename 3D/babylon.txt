Comments
==========================
1. it is the rendering engine, not a modeling tool
2. if you use UV textures youâ€™ll need extra tool anyway
3. So you are saying that using an external object like Blender is a best practice in creating Room kind of scene
4. use textures with pre baked lighting informatio. Very suitable for static scenes.
